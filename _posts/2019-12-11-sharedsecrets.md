In our Christmas editions, we will learn about sharing secrets securely without storing them on a webserver and why sometimes GnuPG simply isn't secure enough.

Join us at SSE ([Secure Systems Engineering](https://securesystems.de/)) where Kenny will talk about "Shared-Secrets Service - Why GnuPG wasn't secure enough". Doors will open at 18:30 with some drinks and snacks. There will be plenty of time to socialise and discuss any issues of interest.

Come and join our community of Berliners interested in everything around cryptography!

# Shared-Secrets Service - Why GnuPG wasn't secure enough. (Kenny Niehage)
Shared-Secrets is a web application that can be used to create links containing encrypted secret information. The application used GnuPG but was recently rewritten to use a custom message format. This talk delves into why GnuPG just wasn't secure enough.

The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/syseleven/shared-secrets). An example implementation is hosted by [SysEleven](https://secrets.syseleven.de/).
