There will be one talk and plenty of time to socialise and discuss any issues of interest.
Come and join our community of Berliners interested in cryptography and everything around it.

# deSEC (Nils Wisiol)
deSEC is an open-source and privacy-friendly DNS hosting service based
in Berlin, Germany. Originally funded by a start-up scholarship, deSEC
now became a Verein and aims to provide permanently free DNS hosting
funded by donations and collaborations, offering features rarely seen in
other providers, such as a restful API, fully automatic DNSSEC,
IPv6-enabled API and nameservers, and immediate update of published DNS
information. In this talk we present the technical organization,
security and privacy of deSEC. Furthermore, we discuss how deSEC can
promote DNS features like TLSA records that today are available, but are
also rarely used.
